    Understand Shell Basics:
        Familiarize yourself with how shells work, including command-line parsing, environment variables, command execution, etc.
        Learn about the basic features of Bash, such as pipelines, redirection, variables, and control structures.

    Lexical Analysis (Lexing):
        Create a lexer to tokenize the input into meaningful units (tokens).
        Identify keywords, operators, literals, etc.

    Syntax Analysis (Parsing):
        Build a parser to create an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokenized input.
        Define the grammar for the shell language.

    Command Execution:
        Implement the execution of simple commands.
        Handle built-in commands separately from external commands.

    Redirection and Pipelines:
        Support input/output redirection (<, >, >>) and pipelines (|).
        Implement the necessary file descriptor manipulation.

    Variable Expansion:
        Handle variable expansion, such as  and .
        Implement parameter substitution.

    Environment Variables:
        Manage environment variables and implement their behavior.
        Support exporting and importing variables between processes.

    Control Flow:
        Implement control structures like loops, conditionals, and functions.
        Support background processes and job control.

    Signal Handling:
        Handle signals to terminate or suspend processes.
        Implement signal handlers for common signals.

    Job Control:
        Manage background and foreground jobs.
        Implement job control features, such as fg and bg.

    Scripting Support:
        Enable the execution of shell scripts by interpreting script files.
        Handle script-specific constructs.

    Error Handling:
        Implement robust error handling for various scenarios.
        Provide informative error messages.

    Interactive Mode:
        Support an interactive mode with a command prompt.
        Implement line editing and command history.

    Built-in Commands:
        Implement commonly used built-in commands like cd, echo, export, etc.

    External Commands:
        Execute external commands by forking and exec-ing processes.
        Handle path resolution and searching for executable binaries.

    Testing:
        Write comprehensive test cases to ensure the correctness of your shell.
        Test various edge cases and error conditions.

    Documentation:
        Document your code and provide usage instructions for your shell.
